## UX (User Experience) ##
---
### Project Goals ###
The **ultimate quiz** to decide for **once and for all** which faction, race, class and role you belong to in the populair MMORPG [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/).

The **goal** for this project is to **entertain** users.

### User Goals ###

* Be **entertained**.
* **Find** beautiful **images** of World of Warcraft races and classes.

### User Stories ###
* As a **user**, I want and **attractive** and **fun** website so I will be **entertained**.
* As a **user**, I want a **site** that loads fast.
* As a **user**, I want to have clearly defined **questions** and **answers**.
* As a **user**, I want to be able to **post** my results to various **social media sites**.
* As a **user**, I want to be able to **mail** the site owner if I have **questions**, want to **suggest content** or pay a compliment.

### Site Owner Goals ###

### Design Choices ###
When **designing** this site, I mainly did a **lot of thinking**. Where **coming up** with the idea wasn't all that hard, the **getting the data structured and usable**, was a whole different ball game.
I've looked at [**other quizzes**](https://www.zimbio.com/quiz/xB6XYrSQXCE/World+Warcraft+Class) that follow a path that is similar to mine and went from there.


**Fonts**

For titles i've used [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) and for the text i've used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont) which come pretty close to the fonts Blizzard uses for their World of Warcraft site.

**Icons**

**Icons** used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in **moderation** and are self explanatory.

**Colors**
Colors that are used, are based on the World of Warcraft colors.
* For body background: Black #000000
