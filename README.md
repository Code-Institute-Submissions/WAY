## UX (User Experience) ##
---
### Project Goals ###
The **ultimate quiz** to decide for **once and for all** which faction, race, class and role you belong to in the populair MMORPG [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/).

The **goal** for this project is to **entertain** users.

While I at first intended to use all playable classes, races and roles, I soon found out that was a bit to much, so I decided to include all playable classes, races and roles up to and including the [Original World of Warcraft Classic Game](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic).
I had a really hard time getting my data in a structure I could work with. So I decided to compress a lot of questions and not use three json files, but instead use one, just to make it more easy ono myself as I was approaching a point to I almost had a burn-out.
### User Goals ###
* **Find** out which [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) faction, race, class and role you are.
* Be **entertained**.
* **Find** beautiful **images** of World of Warcraft races and classes.

### User Stories ###
* As a **user**, I want and **attractive** and **fun** website so I will be **entertained**.
* As a **user**, I want a **site** that loads fast.
* As a **user**, I want to have clearly defined **questions** and **answers**.

### Site Owner Goals ###
* As a **site owner** I want to educate my users.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

**Requirements**
* **Navigate** the website using the navbar.
* Have a **intuitive** layout that is easy to use.
* **Fun questions** that lead to an **equally fun** (and perhaps true) **outcome**.
* Be able to **share** results on **social media**.

**Expectations**
* Quiz is **easy** to use and gives **no errors**.
* Result is **sharable** through **social media** share buttons at the results location.
* Content is **appealing**.

### Design Choices ###
When **designing** this site, I mainly did a **lot of thinking**. Where **coming up** with the idea wasn't all that hard, the **getting the data structured and usable**, was a whole different ball game.
I've looked at [**other quizzes**](https://www.zimbio.com/quiz/xB6XYrSQXCE/World+Warcraft+Class) that follow a path that is similar to mine and went from there.

**Fonts**

For titles i've used [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) and for the text i've used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont) which come pretty close to the fonts Blizzard uses for their World of Warcraft site.

**Icons**

**Icons** used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in **moderation** and are self explanatory.

**Colors**
Colors that are used, are based on the World of Warcraft colors.
* For body background: Black #000000
* For buttons:  Yellow #F7B10A, Blue #009AE4 and Red #EA3012
* For text: Yellow #F7B10A.

**Features** that will be **implemented** in the **future:**

* **Fantasy name generator**: Let's user generate a **character name** to go with the **outcome of the quizz**.
