## UX (User Experience) ##
---
### Project Goals ###
The **ultimate quiz** to decide for **once and for all** which faction, race, class and role you belong to in the populair MMORPG [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/).

The **goal** for this project is to **entertain** users.

While I at first intended to use all playable classes, races and roles, I soon found out that was a bit to much, so I decided to include all playable classes, races and roles up to and including the [Original World of Warcraft Classic Game](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic).
I had a really hard time getting my data in a structure I could work with. So I decided to compress a lot of questions and not use three json files, but instead use one, just to make it more easy ono myself as I was approaching a point to I almost had a burn-out.
### User Goals ###
* **Find** out which [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) faction, race, class and role you are.
* Be **entertained**.
* **Find** beautiful **images** of World of Warcraft races and classes.

### User Stories ###
* As a **user**, I want and **attractive** and **fun** website so I will be **entertained**.
* As a **user**, I want a **site** that loads fast.
* As a **user**, I want to have clearly defined **questions** and **answers**.

### Site Owner Goals ###
* As a **site owner** I want to educate my users.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

**Requirements**
* **Navigate** the website using the navbar.
* Have a **intuitive** layout that is easy to use.
* **Fun questions** that lead to an **equally fun** (and perhaps true) **outcome**.
* Be able to **share** results on **social media**.

**Expectations**
* Quiz is **easy** to use and gives **no errors**.
* Result is **sharable** through **social media** share buttons at the results location.
* Content is **appealing**.

### Design Choices ###
When **designing** this site, I mainly did a **lot of thinking**. Where **coming up** with the idea wasn't all that hard, the **getting the data structured and usable**, was a whole different ball game.
I've looked at [**other quizzes**](https://www.zimbio.com/quiz/xB6XYrSQXCE/World+Warcraft+Class) that follow a path that is similar to mine and went from there.

**Fonts**

For titles i've used [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) and for the text i've used [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont) which come pretty close to the fonts Blizzard uses for their World of Warcraft site.

**Icons**

**Icons** used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in **moderation** and are self explanatory.

**Colors**
Colors that are used, are based on the World of Warcraft colors.
* For body background: Black #000000
* For buttons:  Yellow #F7B10A, Blue #009AE4 and Red #EA3012
* For text: Yellow #F7B10A.

## Features ##
---
**Features** that have been **implemented:**

* Easy to use **navigation** on all screensizes.
* Social Media **buttons**.

**Features** that will be **implemented** in the **future:**

* **Fantasy name generator**: Let's user generate a **character name** to go with the **outcome of the quizz**.
* Option to **check** if that **name** is already **taken** (through an API).
* Option to choose between the **different expansions**. With **every new expansion**, **more classes and races** were added. For future features, I would like to **include** them as well.

## Bugs ##
---
**During development**

Bug name: Buttons not reacting the way I expected.

Description: I was looping through the answers array with a forEach loop, but couldnt make the answers being injected into the buttons. And the buttons where underneath each other, instead of hiding when an answer was clicked.
This has been very frustrating for me, as I felt I was throwing everything I knew at it, including and not limited to documentation, video's and asking help on Slack.
I asked tutor support in the end, who have helped me figure this out. Their hints combined with the help of Mr Bim, has led me to understand what was causing this and how to solve it. 
Part of this was having a array like collection which led to me not being able to use a forEach loop which started this whole thing.

Solution: Change the ```document.querySelector``` to be ```document.querySelectorAll()``` and use for loops so the answers where actually being appended to the amount of buttons that where needed.

**From validation/testing**

**From peer code review**
